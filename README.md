In this task, I implemented both Simple and Multiple Linear Regression using Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. The goal was to understand how regression works and how to evaluate its performance.

First, I imported and preprocessed the dataset (CSV file), then split it into training and testing sets. I used Scikit-learn’s LinearRegression model to train on the data and make predictions.

To evaluate the model’s accuracy, I calculated MAE (Mean Absolute Error), MSE (Mean Squared Error), and R² (R-squared Score). I also visualized the regression line using Matplotlib for simple linear regression and interpreted the model coefficients (intercept and slope).

This task helped me understand how linear regression models the relationship between features and the target variable, and how to measure its performance using real data.
